## Project Overview

This data analysis projects aims to provide insights on the various individuals based on whether or not they purchased a bike. By analyzing these individuals based on age, gender, occupation, education, region etc, we seek to identify the various customer segments of bike purchasers and gain a deeper understanding of these segments in order to boost bike sales. The project also aims to understand segments that are not likely to purchase bikes.

## Data Sources
Bike Purchasers Data: The main dataset used for this analysis is the "customer_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about the individuals. This dataset contains information on a 1,026 individuals using their unique ID numbers and providing details on their income, marital status, education, region, age, whether they purchased a bike or not etc.

## Tools Used
Excel - Data Cleaning and Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The data cleaning and preparation phase was done using a variety of features such as; Find and Replace, If functions and the duplicate finding feature in excel. The following tasks were performed using these features;
- Data Loading and Inspection
- Identification and Removal of Duplicate Values
- Provision of more detailed forms of certain data points e.g "M" to "Male"
- Creation of a new column based on original data provided e.g "Age Brackets" from "Age" column
These tasks were done using a variety of features such as; Find and Replace, If functions and the duplicate finding feature in excel

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The Exploratory Data Analysis involved exploring the customers data to gain useful insights on both those who purchased bikes and those who didn't and answer key questions with the use of pivot tables;
- What is the average income of males and female bike and non-bike purchasers?
- What is the commute of bike and non-bike purchasers?
- What is the age bracket of bike and non-bike purchasers?
- What is the education level of bike and non-bike purchasers?
- What is the occupation of bike and non-bike purchasers?

## Data Visualisation
This entailed the use of visuals to provide a graphical representation of the analyses performed. This analyses also adopted the use of slicers to gain even more detailed insights on the customers data. The visualisation of the customers data was done with the use of the following charts;
- Clustered Column Chart
- Line Chart

## Results/Findings
The analyses results and findings are summarized as follows;
- The average income of both males and females that purchased bikes are higher than that of those that didn't purchase bikes
- On average, non-bike purchasers have a higher commute distance than bike purchasers
- Middle-Aged customers are more likely to purchase bikes while Adolescent and Old customers are less likely to purchase bikes
- Customers in High School, Partial College and Partial High School students are more likely to purchase bikes than aren't to while Bachelor and Graduate Degree holders are less likely to purchase bikes than they are to
- Customers in clerical, management, manual and skilled manual are less likely to purchase bikes than they are to while Professionals are more likley to purchase bikes than they aren't to

## Recommendations
The recommendations from this analysis are summarized as follows;

- Sale of cheaper bikes as an alternative to lower income earners and gain more customers
- Sale of bikes that are convinient for longer commutes distances and boost bike sales amongst customers with longer commute distances
- Embark on marketing campaigns to encourage physical activity of Adolescent and Old people through bikes that a favourable to them. This will boost sales of bikes amongst Old and Adolescent customers
- Collaborate with schools to encourage students in Colleges and High Schools to use and purchase bikes. This can be done by organizing and sponsoring sporting events and providing student discounts on bikes purchases
- Collaborate with companies to provide bikes as an alternative source of commute to its staff at affordable prices and with discounts for bulk purchases

## Limitations
There wasn't enough data provided on the bikes to provide even more detailed insights on the customers data e.g types of bikes purchased, prices of bikes.
